# LMP-forecast
In this project, I have combined Machine Learning and statistical models to forecast Locational Marginal Price (LMP) in day-ahead market of CAISO. No exogenous variable, like demand and generation mix, is used. Rather focus is made on the nature of the time-series, its inherent volatility and auto-correlation structure.
